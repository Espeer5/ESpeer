          <p>My name is Edward Speer and I am an undergraduate student
            at the California Institute of Technology studying computer
            science. My journey is all about people, and the solutions we
            can build when we work together.</p>
          <p>My passion as an emerging software engineer is architecting
            accessible solutions that make tangible change to real problems.
            I believe that good ideas meeting with great design, development, and service
            leads to software that changes lives.
