    <p class="art_text">When I started looking for a Summer internship for 2022, I didn't know what I
    was looking for.  As I work towards my goal of creating great software, I am 
    keenly aware that programming is far from the only skill required. Before work 
    ever lands into the hands of a developer, a huge amount of research and design 
    work is required to gain an understanding of what needs to be created. I knew I 
    needed to explore this; from my classwork my programming skills were progressing rapidly, 
    but I had little to no understanding of how to maneuver within the professional environment
    around software. A need to explore software production at a higher level made a project management
    internship at Texas Department of Transportation the ideal choice for my professional internship
    in 2022.</p>
    <h2 class="article_sub">What did I do?</h2>
    <p class="art_text">  In my internship at TxDOT, I acted as a project manager at the portfolio level and at the project
      level, gaining experience as both a technical project manager and at a higher level. My daily 
      activities consisted of running project status meetings, creating requirements documents, analyzing 
      project metrics and creating leadership reports, and building dashboards from the project portfolio database.
      I was involved with a variety of teams across a large IT organization, and got to forge working relationships 
      with people who had so much to teach me. </p>
    <p class="art_text"> The most unique aspect about working for TxDOT was the keen awareness that none of us were working for the bottom
      line; we were working for the people of the state Texas. Every project I worked on was providing benefit to a 
      user somewhere in the state, and every coworker I worked with understood that what we did each day was part of 
      an ongoing effort to ensure that every user of our transportation system made it home to their loved ones happy 
      and healthy. This meant that in everything I did, my user was the priority. For example, when I designed and produced 
      dashboards from the projects database, my user was ITD leadership, and my goal had to be giving our leaders the quickest, 
      easiest to navigate view of the metrics so that they could quickly view the dashboard and easily understand where we 
      were, so that they could focus on where we were going. The better my dashboard was, the quicker they could get the data
      they needed, and the faster they could focus on architecting a safer, better future for the state of Texas.</p>
    <p class="art_text"> Through the variety of teams I was involved in, I got to experience a variety of roles. As a technical PM, 
      I facilitated meetings and directly baselined and implemented agile and hybrid project schedules. As a team
      lead on an intern project, I set the direction, coordinated with other teams, and led workshops within my 
      team to develop ideas into designs. As a reporter and dashboard developer, I received requirements documents
      and created templates and demos for review, received commentary, and put prototypes into production. No matter
      which hat I was wearing on a particular team, I learned how to maneuver and communicate within an ITIL driven 
      environment effectively. This breadth of experience was the best part of working at TxDOT, where I worked every
      day on real problems and got to make a real impact on real products.
    </p>
    <h2 class="article_sub">What did I learn?</h2>
    <p class="art_text">Before I took on this internship, I could definitely receive a requirements document, draft up 
      a solution, and produce it. If given access to a user to interview, I could run a workshop culminating in the 
      requirements document for the user. If I needed to design and create a solution for a user in a small group of 
      people, I could do that. However, I had no idea at all how this could work across a large, dispersed team, taking
      on a large, long-term project. The frameworks I got to work within in the environment of a large IT organization 
      taught me how to find the people, answers, and data I needed, and not to be shy about bringing ideas or problems 
      to the table. It is already clear to me that in my career this foundational understanding and capability will be
      used time and time again to drive creation and continuous improvement of good ideas if they are to become great 
      products.
    </p>
    <h2 class="article_sub">Let me tell a story...</h2>
    <p class="art_text"> One Wednesday morning in August after I had been at TxDOT for a couple months, I came into 
      our beautiful new Stassney campus and sat at my desk as I always did. I started working on my big Wednesday 
      task for every week, which was authoring a weekly project delivery metrics summary to be issued to ITD leadership 
      at the end of the day. I logged into the database, accessed the dashboards that I had built, contacted some of the 
      project managers, and dug through the project records for the information I needed. My supervisor came in and said
      good morning, and asked me to look over some draft deliverables that had been uploaded by one of our service 
      providers. I checked through these, identified some errors in the language of the document and passed them along
      to the Compliance team to be edited. And then it hit me; It was 9 AM, and I had already contacted 9 different people
      across different parts of our organization comfortably, with no question or doubt about who to go to or how to find
      the information I needed.
    </p>
    <p class="art_text"> While this is something I had begun to take for granted, it was a shocking turnaround from where
      I had been at the beginning of the Summer. I had been plagued in the first month of my internship with constantly 
      searching for the resources, people, and information I needed. Yet now it was simple, I knew where I was going 
      and could get there with confidence. While every organization is different, I know that this internship gave me
      a toolkit for understanding and maneuvering within a complex corporate environment, and that this will play a 
      huge role in my future.
    </p>
    <h2 class="article_sub">What's Next?</h2>
    <p class="art_text">This internship taught me a lot about maneuvering within a large organization centered around
      software solutions. As I continue developing the technical skills I need through my classwork, I will seek out 
      my next internship opportunity as an opportunity to get experience building something. Understanding the business
      needs and business structure will empower me to understand how and why to build software, and I will seek out a 
      position where I can apply both the technical skills I'm learning in school and the understanding I gained through
      this internship to help build something. I know it will be this merging of all the skills I have been building that
      will lead me to where I want to be.
