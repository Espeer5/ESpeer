    <p class="art_text">When I started looking for a Summer internship for 2022, I didn't know what I
    was looking for.  As I work towards my goal of creating great software, I am 
    keenly aware that programming is far from the only skill required. Before work 
    ever lands into the hands of a developer, a huge amount of research and design 
    work is required to gain an understanding of what needs to be created. I knew I 
    needed to explore this; from my classwork my programming skills were progressing rapidly, 
    but I had little to no understanding of how to maneuver within the professional environment
    around software. A need to explore software production at a higher level made a project management
    internship at Texas Department of Transportation the ideal choice for my professional internship
    in 2022.</p>
    <h2 class="article_sub">What did I do?</h2>
    <p class="art_text">  In my internship at TxDOT, I acted as a project manager at the portfolio level and at the project
      level, gaining experience as both a technical project manager and at a higher level. My daily 
      activities consisted of running project status meetings, creating requirements documents, analyzing 
      project metrics and creating leadership reports, and building dashboards from the project portfolio database.
      I was involved with a variety of teams across a large IT organization, and got to forge working relationships 
      with people who had so much to teach me. </p>
    <p class="art_text"> The most unique aspect about working for TxDOT was the keen awareness that none of us were working for the bottom
      line; we were working for the people of the state Texas. Every project I worked on was providing benefit to a 
      user somewhere in the state, and every coworker I worked with understood that what we did each day was part of 
      an ongoing effort to ensure that every user of our transportation system made it home to their loved ones happy 
      and healthy. This meant that in everything I did, my user was the priority. For example, when I designed and produced 
      dashboards from the projects database, my user was ITD leadership, and my goal had to be giving our leaders the quickest, 
      easiest to navigate view of the metrics so that they could quickly view the dashboard and easily understand where we 
      were, so that they could focus on where we were going. The better my dashboard was, the quicker they could get the data
      they needed, and the faster they could focus on architecting a safer, better future for the state of Texas.</p>
    <p class="art_text"> Through the variety of teams I was involved in, I got to experience a variety of roles. As a technical PM, 
      I facilitated meetings and directly baselined and implemented agile and hybrid project schedules. As a team
      lead on an intern project, I set the direction, coordinated with other teams, and led workshops within my 
      team to develop ideas into designs. As a reporter and dashboard developer, I received requirements documents
      and created templates and demos for review, received commentary, and put prototypes into production. No matter
      which hat I was wearing on a particular team, I learned how to maneuver and communicate within an ITIL driven 
      environment effectively. This breadth of experience was the best part of working at TxDOT, where I worked every
      day on real problems and got to make a real impact on real products.
