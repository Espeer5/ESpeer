    <p>When I started looking for a Summer internship for 2022, I didn't know what I
    was looking for.  As I work towards my goal of creating great software, I am 
    keenly aware that programming is far from the only skill required. Before work 
    ever lands into the hands of a developer, a huge amount of research and design 
    work is required to gain an understanding of what needs to be created. I knew I 
    needed to explore this; from my classwork my programming skills were progressing rapidly, 
    but I had little to no understanding of how to maneuver within the professional environment
    around software. A need to explore software production at a higher level made a project management
    internship at Texas Department of Transportation the ideal choice for my professional internship
    in 2022.</p>
