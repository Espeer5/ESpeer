Developing a Github Pages project to build a professional website

This website will host an introduction to me, my resume, some blog content, and some projects.

**To Do**
1) Improve scalability of design -> CSS needs to be more responsive to window size.
2) Optimize for mobile devices.
3) Create blog template to allow me to easily add new blog content if I choose.
4) Purchase domain and set up DNS for hosting
5) Add AdSense to potentially monetize
